= Catmull-Rom Spline

An example program creating Catmull-Rom Splines in OpenGL 4 with tessellation shaders.

== Compiling

You will need GLFW3 and OpenGL libraries and `g++` that has C++11 features.
Otherwise no special build tools are needed, just run `make` in the root directory and the `catmull-rom-spline` binary should be made.

You can change the compiler to be clang or nvcc in the make file by changing the `CXX` variable.
But be warned that this hasn't been tested with those compilers.

== Usage

Click the screen to create control points at your cursor location.
Once at least 4 control points have been created, a Catmull-Rom spline will be created between the second and third point.
Every point after the first 4 will continue the Catmull-Rom spline.
